          processes, driving data insights, and augmenting human potential like

          </h2>
          <p className={`w-full font-['Gotham'] text-2xl leading-[1.25] ${textColor}`}>
            Put simply, AI agents are artificial intelligence that use tools to
            accomplish goals. AI agents have the ability to remember across
            tasks and changing states; they can use one or more AI models to
            complete tasks; and they can decide when to access internal or
            external systems on a user&rsquo;s behalf. This enables AI agents to
            make decisions and take actions autonomously with minimal human
            oversight.
            <br />
            For example, a consumer goods company wanted to optimize its global
            marketing campaigns using an AI agent to transform processes. A
            project that once required six analysts per week now required a
            single employee working with an agent, delivering results in under
            an hour. Here&rsquo;s how it works:
